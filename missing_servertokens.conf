# Description:
# This Apache configuration file is used to test the linter's ability to detect missing security-related directives.
# In particular, the ServerTokens directive is omitted. Without an explicit ServerTokens setting, Apache may leak
# version and module information in HTTP response headers, which can be a security risk. The linter should flag
# the absence of ServerTokens and suggest setting it to 'Prod' for better security.

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
    # ServerTokens directive is missing
