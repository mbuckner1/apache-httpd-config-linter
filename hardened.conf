# Description:
# This Apache configuration file represents a securely hardened setup for testing purposes.
# It includes best-practice directives to minimize information disclosure and reduce attack surface.
# - ServerTokens is set to 'Prod' to limit server version details in HTTP response headers.
# - ServerSignature is set to 'Off' to hide Apache version info from error pages.
# - AllowOverride is set to 'None' to prevent .htaccess overrides, reducing misconfiguration risks.
# - Options disables directory listings (Indexes) and only allows FollowSymLinks.
# - All risky or unnecessary modules are omitted.
# The linter should find no issues with this configuration, serving as a control/baseline test.
