# Description:
# This Apache configuration file enables the mod_status module and exposes the /server-status endpoint.
# When mod_status is enabled and accessible without proper restrictions, sensitive server status information
# (such as uptime, active connections, and configuration details) may be leaked to unauthorized users.
# The linter should detect the presence of mod_status and warn if access to /server-status is overly permissive.
